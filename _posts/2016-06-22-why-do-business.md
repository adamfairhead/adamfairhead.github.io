What business are you in?

A business exists for one of two reasons.

One reason, is to get rich and fat.

The other reason, is to make the world better.

These options are true for employees, as well as business owners. And you can only choose one.

The wealthy know which one to choose.

Good businesses makes a difference. I wish more people believed that. And either started businesses, or chose the businesses they work for, because of the better world they could create, rather than “because Ferrari”.
