*“I’ll decide later.”*

I tell myself this sometimes. You probably do too.

*“Not sure how to reply to this email. I’ll mark as unread for now.”*

*“I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do. I’ll come back to it.”*

Decisions left unmade can start to take up a lot of mental space, preventing you from focusing on solving new (or better) problems.

Take a few minutes to consider…

* Will your decision be the same in the morning?
* What’s the worst that could happen?
* How does it affect the future?

…then decide.

The worst place to stop is at a cross-roads; that's how car accidents happen. If you were wrong, turn around and decide again.

To make an impact, we need to free ourselves of the weight of unmade decisions, so that we can focus on what’s next.

The world needs you.
