Do you have Small Thoughts?

**Small Thoughts** = "*Extracts from an imaginary world where your growth is stunted, and your possibilities limited.*"

When you make something, a Small Thought sounds a bit like this:

*“There, finished. Now, I’m not clear on what it is just yet, but I’m certain that there’s something about what I’ve just created is sufficiently terrible to warrant the complete and utter demise of everything I’ve ever worked for, and the desolation of all I hold dear.”*

What small thoughts are you thinking right now?

Sometimes you may notice them.

What are they telling you?

How could they be limiting your work?

Where did they come from? Who did they come from?

How are they holding you back?

What are you going to do about it?

How would life change if you asked yourself these questions every day?
