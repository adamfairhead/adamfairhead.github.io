title: A new blog begins
---
I’ve been putting off really starting this blog for years.

Have you ever considered blogging? If you have, you’ll have felt the excuses that can prevent you from even starting.

*“I don’t have the time, I have paying work to do.”*

*“I prefer talking to writing.”*

*“I need to let the dog out again, I’ll think about blogging later.”*

*“I need to think about it some more to get it perfect.”*

Ah, now, we’re getting somewhere. “Perfect”.

You can lose yourself in perfection, where nothing begins and nothing ends. **You wither in pursuit of perfection**.

I decided to take an imperfect step today: to get it wrong.

The withered and the dead can’t even try.
