How do you feel about imperfection?

Think about the last time you created something, that wasn’t quite there yet.

How did it make you feel? Probably, one of these two ways:

* Cool, that’s something to consider next
* Oh man, I released a mess

<br>
I’ve gone both ways, many times.

Both responses cause action: One with motivation to improve, and the other with a fear of staying imperfect.

Anything worth creating, in order to be created, must also be imperfect.

Letting go of perfection allows us to live, and to create.

Hopefully, to create an imperfect step toward a better product, community, or world.
