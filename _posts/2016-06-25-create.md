Consuming entertainment is easy.

We’ve had so much practice, you’d think it’d be easy by now!

What many of us have much less practice in, is Creating things.

Creating is essential to improving the lives of others. It too, can be fun.

It isn’t as easy, though: most adults don’t have as much practice. Creating is a habit, just like Consuming is. It’s one you can learn.

When you get the itch to consume, consider creating something instead.

Even if it stinks, it’s better than nothing, which is all you’d have if you never given it a shot, anyway!

Create instead. Who knows what you'll end up with?
