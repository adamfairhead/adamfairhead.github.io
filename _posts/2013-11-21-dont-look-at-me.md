title: Don’t Look At Me

Solving problems rather than making them.

Problem solving is a mental-muscle all good designers love to flex. The passion that accompanies the craft both betters lives and delights designers.

But which is more important?

When design exists to justify its own existence rather than the existence of something else, we’re not problem solving, we’re just looking for problems.

The difference can be harder to detect when architecting more engaging experiences. And there’s nothing wrong with a designer leaving their stamp on a piece, or pushing their creative prowess in every project. On the contrary.

But those creative experiences should still share a simple, fundamental goal with the content they exist for: intent. One could argue that a design with no intent isn’t really design at all, but rather art that happens to adhere to many design practices.

Great design compliments the circumstances that form the setting.

*And looks freaking amazing while doing it.*
