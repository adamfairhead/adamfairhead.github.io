## Back Story

Some of my earliest memories are of making and selling things that I thought people would love.

As a 5 year old, when the weather was nice, I remember making jigsaws and drawings of Power Rangers, then settong up a table at the end of our driveway to sell them to adults. I learned about product-market fit.

At 11, when I discovered computers, and started making online minigames for my friends to play during school lunch breaks, I learned about gathering feedback and iterating on your products.

At 13, when Pokémon cards became the only currency that mattered, and I created a Pokémon trading card game. I learned about distribution. Friends would come over after school to cut/pack them, and get a small commission for sales the following day.

At 15, when 720Kb was a lot of storage space, I created and sold larger video games on floppy disks. I learned about marketing, and that the packaging and presentation was what stood between my games and my $3 pay-days.

At 16, when our house got broadband, I created and circulated an illustrated comic on an online community site. I learned about partnerships, and accessing an audience.

At 17, when online gaming became popular, I created an online community website to source news and team announcements. I learned about leading a tribe, and building a list.

At 20, when 'virtual worlds' were a thing, I created and sold a line of 'virtual clothes', of all things. It paid rent. I learned about passive income, and about building a brand.

At 23, when I graduated university, I became a freelancer. I designed and developed websites for clients. I learned about running a business.

At 26, when I felt a spirit call to serve with a church, I learned about the heart behind the things we create, about about the importance of making a difference.

At 28, I expanded my business to a team with a mission: to help difference-makers make a difference.

That's still our mission.
