> Adam Fairhead is a tea-drinking, business-loving Brit that believes in turning ideas into reality and pains into delight. He spends most of his time in various parts of sunny USA, where he's helped hundreds of businesses grow online.

I got my taste for business as a creative outlet way back in high school. Back when Pokémon cards were currency, and 720Kb could store everything you could ever need.

It was through a combination of my own design of a Pokémon trading card game and some custom minigames on floppy disks that I realized that a great customer experience is what really matters most when you're selling things.

I learned how to add enough value to my trading card game that I could steal away sales from the popular Nintendo-backed trading card game at our campus, and how to sell my own computer games when thousands were available for free online.

In college, I learned how to pay rent using passive income selling ‘virtual clothes’, of all things. I also learned how to build websites that had a positive influence on sales.

Later, I started a website design agency in the UK that helped other businesses better connect with their audiences. This venture grew, supporting me as I traveled, met my wife and immigrated to the United States. I've since worked with a variety of great people, and created some great experiences for customers.

**It's my experience - and my belief - that a superior customer experience can make meaningful businesses grow exponentially, irrespective of competition, and rise to the top of their industries.**

I wonder if that's something you're interested in. Or if it's something that you want for your business. If it is, email me at adam&nbsp;at&nbsp;adam&nbsp;fairhead&nbsp;dot&nbsp;com. I'll be delighted to meet you.
